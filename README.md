# customer_churn

# Overview

Note: This is a SIMPLIFIED VERSION in regards to proprietary projects.

This project implements a machine learning solution to predict customer churn probability using Random Forest classification. The system analyzes customer transaction behavior to identify at-risk customers, enabling targeted retention strategies that resulted in a more focused and efficient loyalty program in production.

Key Business Impact:

Enabled data-driven retention strategies
Improved loyalty program efficiency
Contributed to reduced customer attrition
Integrated with customer lifecycle modeling for LTV forecasting
Features

End-to-End ML Pipeline: From data extraction to prediction serving
Feature Engineering: RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) metrics plus product affinity features
Model Training: Random Forest with hyperparameter tuning
MLOps Integration: MLflow for experiment tracking
Production-Ready: Logging, configuration management, and serialization
